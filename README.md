## My process

  This is the first time I use scss. Think it was a good test to start getting used to this technology. Didn`t use any partials yet, but trained using nesting items. Sometime I felt that nested too much.

  First created the main grid and then subdivided in diferent grids for each section. Finally created the media query for mobile version.

  Last job ended with JS for activating the hamburger button and showing nav menu.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Grid 
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-frist workflow


### What I learned

First time using SCSS, learned to nest items, using scss variables and  and @extend. 

### Continued development

-Improve to add media-queries for different widths.
-Implement function that makes mobile menu extend until the end of the page, and not only the visible area.
